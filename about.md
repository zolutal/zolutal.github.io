Hi! I'm a PhD student at Arizona State University researching Linux kernel security and microarchitecture security. I play CTFs with Shellphish, mostly interested in challenges on binary/kernel exploitation. I'm hoping to use this blog for ctf writeups, side-projects, deconstructing cool research, and whatever else I happen to feel like writing about.
